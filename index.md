# Coming Soon!

FLL Tutorials will be launching in the summer of 2018. Our focus is lessons and resources for _FIRST_ LEGO League. Materials will be customized for the current season, INTO ORBIT. We wanted to create a resource that focuses on FIRST LEGO League and eliminate some of the clutter on our associated-site, EV3Lessons.com. FLL Tutorials will host an INTO ORBIT scorer, INTO ORBIT  planning tools, Coach's Corner articles, and Core Value Activities. There will also be lessons for programming and building related to FIRST LEGO League only.
