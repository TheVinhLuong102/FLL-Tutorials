# Coming Soon!

FLL Tutorials will be launching in the summer of 2018. Our focus is lessons and resources for _FIRST_ LEGO League. Materials will be customized for the current season, INTO ORBIT. We wanted to create a resource that focuses on _FIRST_ LEGO League and eliminate some of the clutter on our associated-site, EV3Lessons.com. 

FLL Tutorials will host an INTO ORBIT scorer, INTO ORBIT planning tools, Coach's Corner articles, and Core Value Activities. There will also be lessons for programming and building related to _FIRST_ LEGO League only.
