Once you have two coaches, you will be able to purchase products for your team. You can add students to your team at any time. You can either have students create an account and apply to be added to your team, or invite students to be on your team.

FIRST LEGO League teams meet in a variety of places.  They meet at schools, shops, community centers, basements and living rooms. You will need enough space for a FIRST LEGO League table, a computer, place to store and build with LEGO and a place to practice presentations.
