### Step 1: Form a Team

Find up to 10 interested students to be on the team. All students must not exceed the maximum age (or other restrictions detailed in the <a href="http://www.firstlegoleague.org/challenge?__hstc=212927755.b8dda8ff22df0199cde07a6839d08c2c.1529421494137.1560127661361.1560167416654.191&__hssc=212927755.1.1560167416654&__hsfp=3676243494#block-block-17">Participation Rules<a/>). If you have more than 10 students, see if you can recruit another parent to help you coach. Some teams do have an application process to narrow the number of students to 10.

### Step 2: Register a Team and Order Materials

Create an account on FIRSTInspires.org. You will need to have two coaches for each team. Coaches will have to go through a Youth Protection Program application before being allowed to coach. Once you have two coaches, you will be able to purchase products for your team from the same Dashboard. You can add students to your team at any time. You can either have students create an account and apply to be added to your team, or invite students to be on your team.

### Step 3: Register for Local Events

This may not occur immediately. Some point after you register on FIRST Inspires, you will receive a mesage from your local coordinator asking you to sign up for events in your area. This often happens only in late August or September. The process and cost varies greatly from region-to-region.

### Step 4: Find a place to meet

FIRST LEGO League teams meet in a variety of places.  They meet at schools, shops, community centers, basements and living rooms. You will need enough space for a FIRST LEGO League table, a computer/laptop, place to store equipment and build with LEGO, and a place to practice presentations.

### Step 5: Gather the Equipment Needed

1. A FIRST LEGO League table built according to challenge specifications.
2. A Challenge Set for the year. You can order that from your FIRST Inspires Dashboard.
3. A LEGO MINDSTORMS robot or a SPIKE Prime robot. You order one from the FIRST Inspires Dashboard or from the LEGO Education website.
4. Any extra LEGO for students to build with (such as the Expansion set)
5. Computer with Internet access. Students will need a computer to do research, program, access all the Challenge Documents and to check for weekly rules updates.

### Step 6: Team Meetings 

Team meetings can occur whenever is mutually convenient. Some teams meet only a few hours a week and others will meet for ten or more hours. How long you meet is up to the team. There is no right or wrong. There will be a meeting guide provided with the 2019-20 challenge that will guide you through the process, but there are also plently of sources online such as FLLTutorials.com and EV3Lessons.com for additional tips and lessons.

### Step 7:  Get Ready for Competition

Make sure that the students are aware of their competition date and work towards this deadline. FIRST LEGO League competitions are long and tiring.  Make sure they are well-fed and hydrated during the day. Some regions have three levels of competitions (qualifier, district, state), some have two (qualifier, nationals), and some have only one (Championship). Each region also has different rules on what is required at the event. You should always follow the tournament director's instructions for an event.

### Step 8: Celebrate the Season

Whether the team wins an award of not, and whether the team qualifies for the next level or not, make sure to celebrate their season. FIRST LEGO League only provides one trophy per team. Some events might provide medals for each student.
