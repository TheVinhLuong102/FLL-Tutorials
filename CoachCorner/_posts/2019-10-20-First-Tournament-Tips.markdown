## Be Sure to Eat and Drink

Make sure to pause to eat/drink. The day can be long and very busy. A non-coach parent could be very helpful in making sure the team eats. e.g. in our region you can order pizza, but someone has to stand in line to get it and the line gets long.

Designate a parent to order/set-up food. We can order and have pizza delivered. My principal always takes care of this for us and even finds a location in the facility where we can eat. Also bring snacks and drinks!

Hydrate all the time, but add more water a few days before, during, and after the event

Also, check with your tournament organizer to see where food and beverages are allowed. Some locations don't have any restrictions. Some won't even allow water anywhere but in designated cafeteria areas.

## Keep Track of Time

Have someone help with timekeeping! Our first time out we had to Sprint (robot in hand!!) From pit to arena because we didn't hear an announcement that they had moved the times up! Walk the layout of your venue and be extra vigilant for last minute time table changes.


## Make a Checklist of Everything to Take

Be deliberate in packing for a competition. Pit areas are often small, so definitely take what you need for robot, presentations and downtime activities, but nothing more. Or, if you're not sure you need something and want it "just in case" leave it in your vehicle or with another parent.
Also, if you as the coach is hauling everything, make arrangements to meet in the parking lot so the whole team carries stuff in. Just because you're the coach, it doesn't mean you're the designated pack mule.


Power strip is a must; sharpies, copies of competition schedule, phone list of parents and coaches, snacks if allowed, good camera to record presentation and runs, extra cords of all kinds, extra charged EV3 battery just in case, kleenex, pepto-bismol or tums.

## Share Schedules

Sharpie on your arm. If you've ever been in a swim meet you know the coach will write with a Sharpie times and events on swimmers arms. Sharpie all of your judging, practice times, and event times. You'll lose a sheet of paper, you'll misplace your phone, but you won't lose your arm.
Especially helpful with multiple teams.

I print out name tags with the teamâ€™s schedule the morning of or night before and lend them lanyards. Sharpie is a good solution if you get your schedule too late, or there are changes.

 I do the lanyard thing too. Most tournaments seem to want the kids to have some sort of name tag but the sticky ones get ragged by halfway through the day (no idea how but, well, 10 year old boys) so I create name tags with each student's first name, our team logo/something from the t-shirt design and our team name and number and put them in a plastic holder sleeve on a lanyard. In the back of the plastic I add another piece of paper with preprinted lines. When we get our final schedule, everyone fills out the lines with the time, event and location (in time order!) and sticks it back in their holder. Then everyone always has the schedule around their neck. I take a picture of mine and text it to all the parents who will be there so they know our schedule.
 
 Take a picture of your schedule and set it as the screen saver on your phone. Also set alarms before each sessions.

## Activities for Downtimes

 Tournament day is a long day and there will be down time. Bring activities, games, balls for the kids to keep them occupied during the down times. Also set parent expectations of what will happen at a tournament. I remember my very first tournament as a parent and it was so overwhelming! Know if spectators are allowed in the judging rooms (sometimes they are, sometimes they aren't. Depends on your region). Prepare parents that they may only see the robot game. Also, tournament day is loud and hectic. If you have any kids on the team that are sensitive to noise, have a plan in place to accommodate those team members.
 
  I found that it was go go go go go from the second we got there until we were through all the judging and games. Then it was wait wait wait wait wait and that is a VERY hard transition. We are in MI and therefore our teams are young that the three hour wait from between all the judging and games is LONG and exhausting. By the time they get to awards they are wiped out and just ready for the day to be over. I am hoping for some nice weather so we can play some outside games. I want to bring bag toss etc. We also suggested parents bring some pillows and blankets so some naps can be taken in the backs of cars, just to let them get away from the venue for a bit ... there's only so much dancing and loud music you can tolerate.

## Special Needs

 I will add to that. If you have kids with any sort of special needs, reach out the Judge Advisor/Tournament Director ahead of time. They will try to help - they can let judges know in advance, they can arrange for "quiet space" if they have room, etc..There is usually a Coach meeting first thing in the morning with the Judge Advisor, Head Referee and Tournament Director. That's a great time for the coaches to ask questions and let them know of any special arrangements needed.
 
  I would encourage coaches to reach out to regional partners, tournament directors, head ref, judge advisor, etc BEFORE the morning of the tournament to let them know if there are any kids with special needs, you need to request any accommodations, etc. The morning of a tournament is always stressful and there's usually not a lot of time at the coach's meeting. Getting information out ahead of time makes getting accommodations made easier and less stressful for everyone.
  
  Also, it is LOUD, if you have any kids with sensitivities it is good to know this going in. Noise canceling headphones are a must for some of these kiddos.

## Spare Parts

## Jackets

If you live somewhere it will be cold, bring a couple of big trash bags for everyone's coats. Otherwise they all end up on the dirty floor.

## Know Where Your Team Is

Know where your team is. Callbacks can happen in the pit...so you have to be able to find team members easily when judges show up.
