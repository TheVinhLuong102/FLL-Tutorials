### What are some useful extra parts a team should have? Where can these be bought?

**Watch what part the teams use most**

Keep an eye out on the sorted bins. The ones that seem to be depleted the most are the parts to replace first. 

**Where can you buy extra parts**

 Craigslist, Ebay, Bricklink, LEGO Education, LEGO Bricks and Pieces, Amazon Prime, 

**Buy Technic Sets**
Technic sets are a great way of learning new building techniques, but also a great source of spare parts.The Bucket Wheel Excavator (LEGO set 42055) represents excelent value for money. There are lots of frames and panels in this set.

**Use of FIRST LEGO League Challenges**

FIRST LEGO League sets have lots of interesting parts in them. Over the last few years, they have even contained many of the new Technic elements for the year.

**What parts are useful**
Here are a list of useful parts from Not the Droids You Are Looking For, the World Festival Champions from 2018.
