### Step 1: Form a Team

Find up to 10 interested students to be on the team. All students must not exceed the maximum age (or other restrictions detailed in the <a href="http://www.firstlegoleague.org/challenge?__hstc=212927755.b8dda8ff22df0199cde07a6839d08c2c.1529421494137.1560127661361.1560167416654.191&__hssc=212927755.1.1560167416654&__hsfp=3676243494#block-block-17">Participation Rules<a/>). If you have more than 10 students, see if you can recruit another parent to help you coach. Some teams do have an <a href="http://flltutorials.com/coachcorner/coaching/2018/07/24/Team-Applications.html">application process</a> to narrow the number of students to 10.

### Step 2: Register a Team and Order Materials

Create an account on FIRSTInspires.org and register a team ($225). You will need to have two coaches for each team. Coaches will have to go through a Youth Protection Program application before being allowed to coach. Once you have two coaches, you will be able to purchase products for your team from the same Dashboard. You can add students to your team at any time (not necessarily at the time of registration). You can either have students create an account and apply to be added to your team, or invite students to be on your team.

### Step 3: Register for Local Events

This may not occur immediately. Some point after you register on FIRST Inspires, you will receive a mesage from your local regional FIRST LEGO League coordinator asking you to sign up for events in your area. This often happens only in late August or September. The process and cost varies greatly from region-to-region.

### Step 4: Find a place to meet

FIRST LEGO League teams meet in a variety of places.  They meet at schools, shops, community centers, basements and living rooms. You will need enough space for a FIRST LEGO League table, a computer/laptop, place to store equipment and build with LEGO, and a place to practice presentations.

### Step 5: Materials Needed

1. A Challenge Set for the year ($75). You can order that from your FIRST Inspires Dashboard. The set includes one Challenge Mat as well has numbered bags of LEGO brick. Intructions to build the models in the set will be availble on August 1 of each year. <a href="http://www.firstlegoleague.org/missionmodelbuildinginstructions> Build Instructions </a>
2. A FIRST LEGO League table built according to challenge specifications (approx $100). The Challenge Mat will be positioned on this table according to instructions.
3. A LEGO MINDSTORMS robot ($496) or a SPIKE Prime robot ($410). You can order one from the FIRST Inspires Dashboard or from the LEGO Education website. The Expansion set for each product is included in the bundle that you can purchase from FIRST.
4. Any extra LEGO Technic for students to build with
5. An electronic device with the software for MINDSTORMS or Spike Prime installed. A device with Internet access is needed to do project research, access all the Challenge Documents, download software, and to check for weekly rules updates.
6. Other useful materials include a white board for team discussions, poster boards for presentations, calendar for a team schedule, pens/pencils, and storage boxes for robots. You might also need 
7. Engineering Notebooks and a Meeting Guide are provided with registration.

### Step 6: Team Meetings 

Team meetings can occur whenever is mutually convenient. Some teams meet only a few hours a week and others will meet for ten or more hours. How long you meet is up to the team. There is no right or wrong. There will be a meeting guide provided with the 2019-20 challenge that will guide you through the process, but there are also plently of sources online such as <a href="http://www.flltutorials.com">FLLTutorials</a> and <a href="http://www.ev3lessons.com">EV3Lessons</a> for additional tips and lessons.

### Step 7:  Get Ready for Competition

Make sure that the students are aware of their competition dates and work towards these deadlines. Some regions have three levels of competitions (qualifier, district, state), some have two (qualifier, nationals), and some have only one (Championship). Each region also has different rules on what is required at the event. You should always follow the tournament director's instructions for your event.

### Step 8: Celebrate the Season

Whether the team wins an award of not, and whether the team qualifies for the next level or not, make sure to celebrate their season. Note that FIRST LEGO League only provides one trophy per team. Some events might provide medals for each student.
