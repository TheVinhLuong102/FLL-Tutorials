The following is based on discussions from the Facebook Group <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/FLLShareandLearn/">FLL: Share & Learn </a>.

Engineering Journals are not required in FIRST LEGO League, but often a great way to record your team’s progress in Robot Design.

### Why an Engineering Journal? (by Annie Drennan)
The first year it was hard to implement, but the second year I worked harder on getting kid buy-in at the beginning of the season and they did WAY better. The funny thing is, I told the kids it would benefit them throughout the season, but if I’m going to be fully honest, I mostly thought it would be something that would benefit them in judging, but not really be very helpful to them. They taught me to see it differently.

The Engineering Notebook helped in a few big ways: <br>
1-    They could get started again the next practice much faster. Because they had written down what they’d done and what they thought they should do next, they didn’t have to waste time trying to remember where they left off. <br>
2-    For the kids who tend to get lost in the “I can make an accordian to pick stuff up for fun” mode, it gave a non-stressful pressure (that didn’t come from a coach) to accomplish SOMETHING they could write about<br>
3-    It’s almost like having a backup of your programming for your mechanical designs. If they go down a path that they find out was pretty lousy, they can use pictures to go back to a previous version. If something breaks, they can use previous pictures to put it back together. <br>
4-    It helped the kids to organize and plan what they wanted to do for themselves. The first few times for most and several for some, they needed me to read it over and ask questions like “When you say you made it better, how did you make it better and can you quantify how much?” But over time, a lot of the time, they became much more detailed and then they could see all they had accomplished that day (most days), and even more importantly, they could plan what needed to happen next while it was fresh in their minds. This, to me, was the biggest benefit. Because, at the end of a practice, they know what’s not working yet. But next practice there’s a good chance neither of us will remember.


Two years ago my team chose to do the engineering notebook in Google Docs because they all went to a school where they had iPads and used Google Docs a lot. We’ve continued with that. It works pretty well, because they can make an entry at home, and if needed, they take any pictures and notes they might need ahead of time. Many of these entries I don’t see until they print the notebook and many warm my little coach’s heart or take me down memory lane.

Some kids hate this and some kids love it, but in my opinion, both groups benefit from it and once they get used to it, both groups seem to see the value in it.

### What goes in an Engineering Journal? (by Amy Heider)

Put EVERYTHING in it.

It's good practice to ask the kids to write up what they worked on that day. Document what worked. What didn't. Use it as a place to save your brainstorm ideas in case the kids want to revisit any of them. If you can get the kids to make a timeline of deadlines before tournament, record it there -- and then check off when you hit the actual milestones. Don't worry if it shows failures -- it is all about showing what the kids learned, and how they did it.

There's no big right or wrong. But if in the judging room, a judge says, "How did you decide to do it this way?" and one of your kids can point to the specific place in the notebook where that decision was recorded? Job well done.

And if you just have notes: tape them into an Engineering Notebook. Seriously. And yes, it really is of limited, occasional usefulness in the judging room due to time constraints. It is endlessly useful for the team. Getting into ruthlessly documenting everything you do and when you do it is key in engineering.

### What is the best format for an Engineering Notebook? (by Jennifer Seitz)

[Google Docs, Google Science Journal are very popular among FIRST LEGO League teams. There is no right or wrong way. A simple wired notebook, or even a binder works. Below are two alternative ideas that might work for your team.]

I had them use a bound engineering notebook (and multiple kids working on different attachments at the same time) to reinforce the idea that you don’t tear out or throw away when something gets messed up. We basically recorded, sketched, and put photos of what they were working on during every practice, with an explanation of what they were trying to solve, identify the potential challenges, the actual outcome and what their plan is for the next practice - how they’re going to improve it, etc.

We had varying success. I had a couple of kiddos who were fantastic, and I had some who it was like pulling teeth. The main goal, really, was to develop the process and to demonstrate that sometimes they might want to revisit an idea and it’s easier when it’s all there. We did take it into judging sessions and present it. The judges really only glanced at it because there is just so little time so they focus more on the actual robot.

We're lucky enough to have a big whiteboard where our team meets. The kids are pretty good about using the whiteboard while they're brainstorming, then I would take pictures of that. Not exactly organized, but it's better than nothing.

### Including a Code Binder: (by Christopher Haines)

Having a printed copy of your code can be useful as a backup to your laptop. Include that in your Engineering Journal as well.

My team put together a binder containing our mission planning / pseudo code, along with actual code (several missions had multiple sets of code to show how the team modified it as they went along), and a picture of the robot in it's starting position. Our judges loved it, and gave the team high marks for it.

### Age-appropriate Expectations: (by Asha Seshan)

Remember that in FIRST LEGO League teams develop skills each year. The goal is not to have a rookie team writing detailed FTC-style Engineering Journals.  Start with age-appropriate expectations.  Treat the first year more as a “journal”.  Writing in a journal is something most elementary school kids have been exposed to at some point. Tell them to answer questions such as: “What did we do today?” and “What do we need to improve on/work on for next time?”  Have the kids include some photos and a few sentences.

As they increase their experiences in FIRST LEGO League and get older, encourage them to capture more details in their Journal.  The sentences will change to paragraphs, and the kids will learn what is important to capture.

Have everyone on the team involved so that no one feels like they alone got boring homework. It’s a group effort.
