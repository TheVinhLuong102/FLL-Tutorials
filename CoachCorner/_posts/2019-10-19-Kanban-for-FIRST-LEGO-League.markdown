## What is Agile

“Agile” is a buzzword that is loaded with different meanings that apply in different circumstances. Agile software development comprises various approaches to software development under which requirements and solutions evolve through the collaborative effort of self-organizing and cross functional teams and their customer(s)/ end user(s). It advocates adaptive planning, evolutionary development, early delivery, and continual improvement, and it encourages rapid and flexible response to change.

The term agile (sometimes written Agile) was popularized, in this context, by the Manifesto for Agile Software Development. The values and principles espoused in this manifesto were derived from and underpin a broad range of software development frameworks, including Scrum and Kanban.

Core principals of the Agile methodology that’s not limited to software
development

• Iterative, incremental and evolutionary<br>
• Efficient and face-to-face communication<br>
• Very short feedback loop and adaptation cycle Quality focus<br>

## What is Kanban

Kanban (Japanese 看板, signboard or billboard) is a method to manage and improve work across human systems. This approach aims to manage work by balancing demands with available capacity, and by improving the handling of bottlenecks.

Work items are visualized to give participants a view of progress and process, from start to finish— usually via a Kanban Board.

In knowledge work and in software development, the aim is to provide a visual process management system which aids decision-making about what, when, and how much to produce. 

The underlying Kanban method originated in lean manufacturing, which was inspired by the Toyota Production System. Kanban is commonly used in software development in combination with other methods and frameworks such as Scrum.

## What is Kanban board

A Kanban board can be physical – which is how most teams start using Kanban – or electronic. A typical Kanban board consists of multiple columns to depict the workflow process (also referred to as Value Stream) that it is used to manage. A Kanban board represents a “virtual kanban system” used to model the process and track the knowledge work being done by your team.

You can start with a physical Kanban board on a whiteboard/ soft-board or perhaps some large glass windows or partitions in your office. The bigger and more visible they are, the better!

The columns on the board fall in 3 buckets –
• To Do (popularly called the ‘Ready’) column contains all your cards that are next up. Typically, a
 ready column is placed at the start of the board.
• Doing (or ‘In Progress’) column(s) contains all cards that you are currently working on. You can have multiple Doing columns for each stage of your workflow, as shown above.
• Done column(s) contains all cards that you have finished working on. You will also typically have a final Done column which might be highlighted uniquely, to indicate that all work on the cards in that column has been completed.

### Limit work in process (WIP)

Many people believe that multitasking is equivalent to being productive. However, the Kanban process says the opposite. With this project management method, you’ll instead focus on completing one actionable task at a time. The idea is to accomplish the optimal amount of work without losing efficiency in the process. Dedicating your attention to one task keeps your mind from wandering, and allows you to get into deep focus. When you complete a task, you move on to the next one. This continues for a team until the project is complete.

## Combining Kanban board for FLL (First Lego League) Challenge

Most of the FIRST seasons are very short – starting Challenge release on Aug. 1st to Regional Championship event by mid Nov. There are lot of things that needs to be completed in short duration, making it hard not just for rookie teams but also for the experienced teams. For most part, it all falls on coaches and at times teams suffers just because of this.

While the performance is focal, there are three other areas that are independently judged and scored: research, design, and core values. The tournaments are structured such that you cannot succeed with performance points alone. You need to do well in research, design, and core values too. We need to care deeply how our teams work. “Get it done” isn’t okay – Instead we need to cultivate learning, experimentation, innovation, thoughtful design, thorough research, mutual respect, and empathy.

The idea here to empower kids using Kanban board and take initiative instead of them waiting for their coaches and mentors to provide the directions. Making them truly self-organized team ! Our team is called LightingBots. We’re made up of six middle schoolers between the ages of 12 and 13 along with two high school mentors. We are getting ready for our season, and would like share some of the best practices that directly apply to my profession of leading teams in enterprise technology.

## How Kanban Board works

So mixing up my professional career and robotics coach role, I was excited to apply Agile development principles to the process and see if it would work with bunch of middle-schoolers and pile of Lego bricks. We put up a Kanban board. Our Kanban board consists everything (Project research, robot building and programming, and core values). If this is too much, you can setup 3 separate cards for each challenge area.

### Steps to setup / Maintain Kanban board
Create a Kanban board, either physically or virtually, to visualize tasks. At this point, let’s assume you’ve set your goals, come up with the necessary projects and associated tasks for each one. You’ll then create a column for each of the following: done, in progress, not done.
  
1. Brainstorm ideas on what needs to be done within season - I encourage kids to come up with the tasks they need to perform and create sticky / post-it notes for each. <br>
2. Put everything under ‘To do..’ column first <br>
3. We estimate the development effort for each card / sticky. <br>
4. Identify and assign only 6 post-it notes (we have 6 kids so assuming each kid will work on his/her
independent sticky) from ‘To do..’ to ‘In Progress’ work <br>
5. Once task is complete encourage whoever is working on it, move it to Done column.<br>
6. And whoever is done can pick up another sticky from ‘To Do’ column <br>
7. How ‘cool’ is this!! Sometimes I don’t stay in the meetings purposely to see how kids are doing
without me – and they do really well.<br>

### Innovation Project Example
- Complete background research <br>
- Meeting to share research update <br>
- Discuss approaches to the problem statement and solutions <br>
- Brainstorming the solutions <br>
- Create prototype<br>
....and so on<br>

### Robot Game Example
- Create mission models and set them on the mat <br>
- Identify, brainstorm on attachment creation<br>
- Define strategy around mission route<br>
- Build, design and program robot<br>
- Program for mission<br>
- Capture each mission completion time ...and so on<br>

Once we reach our milestone, we do retrospectives. I have tripod board with column and stickie’s. (You can utilize development computer to large tv, Trello board and make fully electronic board as well.)

## Why Kanban Board ?

I cannot say that these methods alone made us wildly successful, but it definitely made the team practices engaging and enjoyable. These principles facilitated learning and collaboration, which is what it is all about.

• Kids love it and they find it supercool! <br>
• Kanban board gives clarity on what needs to be done via lots of brainstorming ideas <br>
• Work is divided into smaller and more manageable tasks; Keeps things organized and visible <br>
• Clarity around what each team member(s) are working on <br>
• Responsibility, allows for focused and more efficient work <br>
• Accountability <br>
• Time management <br>
• Kanban board can be adjusted to your process and team <br>
• Raise concern if someone is stuck somewhere and fine the right link for help – courage to speak
up <br>
• Most of the time kids are surprised how much they accomplished within 2 hours meeting – Sense of accomplishment / Pride in what they do!! <br>

Ideas on how to make your Kanban board interesting for kids Kanban Lego board

## Conclusion

As a coach, one of the hardest things for me was to let the kids do the work. The challenge is quite engaging. I really wanted to put my hands on the keyboard to write the code, and I wanted to dive into the Lego bin to build mechanical attachments.

This was the most tempting when it looked like my team was going down the wrong path. The team made the design choices, not me. I provided guidance, but the team made the decisions, even if they were the wrong ones. Sure, we burned valuable time chasing ideas that I knew would fail, but I needed the team to learn. I believe that learning works best when experiencing the results of your own decisions, not just by listening to what the coach says.

With the help of Kanban board, I can say that kids on my team know what they are doing and able to help others. Putting together this article with the hope that this will help many more teams.
