## Tips for Successful Virtual Team Meetings</a>

1) Everyone needs to have access to a computer with Internet access <br>

2) A webcam will help the team feel more connected to each other <br>

3) A pair of headphones with a microphone with eliminate background noise and increase concentration <br>

4) Encourage everyone to stay on "mute" until they want to speak<br>

5) Most tools have a chat/message feature. Students can use that to post questions/comments as others speak. Some even have a "raise hand" feature. <br>

6) Make sure students learn how to share their screens so that they can share any documents or presentations they make. <br>

7) Teach good video conferencing etiquette - everyone can't speak at once, so you have to learn to take turns and cooperate.<br>

8) Some tools have breakout rooms. These can be useful for having simultaneous subteam meetings and where the coach can so by and visit.<br>

9) Remember to ensure that the teams are having fun. You might encourage themed meetings - "wear a silly hat", "orange day", "bring a snack", etc

10) Remember that students who are FLL-age probably do not enjoy long meeting times. Encourage some independent work after initial brainstorming and then have them report back/share their work. The breakout rooms will also help break up longer meetings.
