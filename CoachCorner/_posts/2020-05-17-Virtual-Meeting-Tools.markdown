## Tips for Successful Virtual Team Meetings

1) Everyone needs a computer with Internet access <br>

2) A webcam will help the team feel more connected to each other. Depending upon the tool, the student can blur the background or create a virtual one. <br>

3) A pair of headphones with a microphone will eliminate background noise and increase concentration <br>

4) Encourage everyone to stay on "mute" until they want to speak<br>

5) Most tools have a chat/message feature. Students can use that to post questions/comments as others speak. Some, like Zoom, even have a "raise hand" feature. <br>

6) Make sure students learn how to share their screens so that they can share any documents or presentations they make. <br>

7) Teach good video conferencing etiquette - everyone can't speak at once, so you have to learn to take turns and cooperate.<br>

8) Some tools have breakout rooms. These can be useful for having simultaneous subteam meetings and where the coach can so by and visit. So for example, you could have half the team working on the research project while the other half are brainstorming what their robot should look like.<br>

9) Remember to ensure that the teams are having fun. You might encourage themed meetings - "wear a silly hat", "orange day", "bring a snack", etc. You can still celebrate birthdays and other achievements.

10) Remember that students who are FLL-age probably do not enjoy long meeting times. Encourage some independent work after initial brainstorming and then have them report back/share their work. The breakout rooms will also help break up longer meetings.

11) Parents should be encouraged to help the students get set up and to also make sure that the student is using the Internet responsibly when participating in FIRST LEGO League.
