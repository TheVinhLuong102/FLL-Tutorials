Core Values Activity:  Making sure everyone has a turn
<!--more-->

<b>Objectives:</b>
- Giving everyone a trurn
- Following instructions

<b>Materials:</b>
- 1 gummy worm (Fred)
1 gummy life saver candy (life preserver) – it must be the gummy kind, not the hard kind
1 small, clear plastic cup (boat)
4 paper clips (rescue materials)
Optional: Small tray (lake)
Student instructions
Optional: Student worksheet

<b>Setup:</b>
- Place the gummy life saver in the middle of the tray. Turn the small, plastic cup (Fred’s boat) upside down and place it over the gummy life saver. Finally, place the gummy worm on top of the plastic cup and the four paper clips to the side.

<b>Instructions to Team:</b>

Explain that Fred is a friendly worm who took his boat out on the lake one day. However, Fred wasn’t very smart because he forgot to wear his life preserver! Unfortunately for Fred, a strong wind caused his boat to capsize. Now his boat is upside down, Fred is stranded on top, and his life preserver is underneath!

Then have your students work in groups of 2-3 people to (1) turn Fred’s boat right side up, (2) get Fred back into his boat, and (3) put on Fred’s life preserver.

However, students must follow certain rules:

1. Students may only touch the paperclips. They may not touch Fred, the boat, or the life preserver directly with their hands.

2. Students must not let Fred fall into the lake or he will drown.

3. Students may not injure Fred (e.g., spearing him with the end of a paperclip).


<b>Notes:</b>

Variation: After they accomplish it, have the team member face the opposite direction in the circle so that nobody can see each other.
